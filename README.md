# Sportmonks Football API PHP Client

PHP Library for [Sportmonks](https://www.sportmonks.com/) Soccer API v3. Initially developed by [Carsten Tetzlaff](mailto:carsten-tetzlaff@outlook.com), extended by [Giannis Feidaros](mailto:giannisfd@gmail.com). This Library is heavily inspired by https://github.com/joesaunderson/sportmonks-soccer.

## Prerequisites

PHP >= 7.3

## Installation

```
composer require tetzilla/sportmonks-football-api:dev-master
```

## Setup

The API Client relies on [Environment variables](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.environment.php) for 
configuration (setting API token & timezone).

## Prerequisites

PHP >= 7.3

Install:
```
composer require symfony/dotenv
```

Usage:
```
use Symfony\Component\Dotenv\Dotenv;
$dotenv = new Dotenv();
$dotenv->load(__DIR__.'/.env');
```

An example .env file:

```dotenv
# API TOKEN (Required)
# https://docs.sportmonks.com/football/welcome/authentication
SPORTMONKS_API_TOKEN=_YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE

# TIMEZONE (Optional)
# https://docs.sportmonks.com/football/tutorials-and-guides/tutorials/introduction/set-your-time-zone
SPORTMONKS_TIMEZONE=Europe/London
```

## Usage

```php
use Sportmonks\Football\FootballApi;

...

// Basic API call for all Bookmakers
$response = FootballApi::bookmakers()->getAll();
```

## Pagination, Filtering, Sorting & Data Enrichment 

The [Sportmonks API](https://docs.sportmonks.com/football/tutorials-and-guides/tutorials/introduction/make-your-first-request) 
allows for advanced filtering and sorting, as well as adding data via relationships. This client supports the following:

### Pagination

```php
// API call for Fixtures with page specified 
$response = FootballApi::fixtures()
    ->setPage(3)
    ->getByDate('2023-03-19');
```

Note: The pagination (`$response['pagination']`) can be used to loop through pages and build a result set.

### Includes

```php
// API call for Fixtures with includes
$response = FootballApi::fixtures()
    ->setInclude(['scores', 'lineups', 'events'])
    ->getByDate('2023-03-19');
```

### Filtering
// API call for Fixtures with filters
```php
$response = FootballApi::fixtures()
    ->setInclude(['events','statistics.type'])
    ->setFilter(['eventTypes:18,14'])
    ->getByDate('2023-03-19');
```

### Select

```php
// API call for Fixtures with select
$response = FootballApi::fixtures()
    ->setSelect(['id', 'name', 'starting_at'])
    ->getByDate('2023-06-30');
```

Note: This client will not validate the usage for the correct endpoints and will not throw an error. Refer to the 
[Sportmonks docs](https://docs.sportmonks.com/football/endpoints-and-entities/endpoints) to see which endpoints support the above parameters.
